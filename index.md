# Arduino Midi Controller
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was soldering all the componenets to a perfboard and putting everything in a box. I soldered wires to every componenet and haphazardly stuck them in the perfboard, connecting ground with ground and 5volt with 5volt with large amounts of solder. I also drilled circular holes in the top of the box to put the buttons and knobs in, as well as a circular hole that I spent half an hour filing into a rectangle for the USB that powered the arduino. after stuffing everything into the box, I hooked it up to my computer and played around with it, making a demo song with Delay Lama.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was finishing the code and prototype of the midi machine. I searched online for the libraries I needed and yoinked the code I needed from several websites. Then, I wired a single button and a single poteminator to the breadboard with test code in order to figure out how they worked. After realizing that I can add as many buttons as I want because it doesn't use voltage, I chose to have 8 buttons and 4 knobs. I chose not to use sliders and stuck to knobs, because the sliders heated up when I wired them. After fully wiring everything, I downloaded some software that was compatible with arduino, and made sure the componenets worked.

# Starter Project - Arduino 8x8 Neopixel Matrix
  
For my starter project, I built an 8x8 pixel matrix. To do this, I had to wire the matrix to the arduino. This was really easy, so I added a button to it. I only had 2 components, so I didn't need to use a breadboard. I searched up the libraries I needed and added them, then wrote a couple of lines of code that made the matrix glow red when I pressed the button, then switch to green and fade away when I release it.
